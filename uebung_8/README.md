## README Ãœbung 8

The Code in this Folder was mainly written by the Institut H2T of the Karlsruhe Institut of Technology.
There were no Licence File in the given Code.
However, I don't copyed the whole Code to this Repository. To make the code run, you have to install simox (https://gitlab.com/Simox/simox/wikis/Installation-Source-Ubuntu) and the given Code from Ilias (no acess for the public).  
Only the lines within the TODO sections were written by me.

To understand the Code, there are many comments that explain the algorithm, as well as the C++ code. So you don't have to know anything about C++ to understand how the A*-Algorithm and the RRT-Algorithm is implemented.
